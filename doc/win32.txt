Compiling Quixote c extensions for Windows using the mingw compiler:

The variable build_extensions in setup.py must be set to True (instead
of "sys.platform != win32"). Then, Quixote can be installed through

   python setup.py build_ext --compiler=mingw32 install

The mingw compiler can be downloaded from
http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html. Probably you need to list
the bin directory (C:\Program files\Dev-Cpp\bin) in the PATH.

To permit gcc to link against Python library, you also need a
libpython2x.a file. Instructions for its creation are provided at
http://sebsauvage.net/python/mingw.html.
