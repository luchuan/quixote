WSGI and Quixote
================

"WSGI" stands for the Python Web Server Gateway Interface, defined in
`PEP 333 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>`__.

The function ``quixote.get_wsgi_app()`` returns a WSGI application
object for the current publisher instance.

This WSGI application ties into the publisher at the ``process_request``
method, and bypasses the ``process`` method completely.

An Example
----------

For example, you can use the ``wsgiref`` module (included with
Python 2.5 and later) to serve a Quixote application. ::

   your_app.create_publisher()
   wsgi_app = quixote.get_wsgi_app()

   from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
   make_server('', 8000, wsgi_app)
