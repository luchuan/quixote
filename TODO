* Extend HTTPRequest to support single/multiple-valued fields.

* Make bare return statements inside of PTL templates work as expected.

* Allow __init__.ptl files to be used as package markers.  It looks like
  something is wrong with the way ihooks handles __init__ modules.

* Logging doesn't work with CGI scripts (something about our
  log-opening code depends on how fastcgi.py fiddles stdout).

* For OpenBSD: fcgi.py should catch SIGTERM and, umm, do something.
  (Terminate the process?)  Otherwise, the FastCGI process can no longer
  accept() on its socket.  (Reported by Robin Wöhler
  <rw@robinwoehler.de>, 2002/08/02.)

* For Mac OS X: _startup() in fcgi.py doesn't work for some reason on
  OS X.  Figure out why and fix it (or kludge around it).
